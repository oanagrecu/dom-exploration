# Exercise Summary

This exercise involves editing the script.js file to implement the following functionalities:

1.Every time the user clicks on one of the action squares:

Create a new <div> with the class .displayedsquare in the div above (displayedsquare-wrapper) and set the corresponding clicked color.
Create a new <li> in the log below to indicate when the action was performed.
Add an event listener on the document <body> to listen for the keypress event.

2.When the spacebar is pressed, randomly change the background color of the whole page.
3.Log when the spacebar is used, similar to how the generated squares are logged.
When the 'l' key is pressed, delete the log entries (erase the generated <li> elements).

4.When the 's' key is pressed, delete the generated squares.

5.Erase the previously generated squares from the DOM.
6.Implement a system where clicking on a generated square triggers an alert with the color of that square.

Please refer to the script.js file for the complete implementation details of these exercises.
